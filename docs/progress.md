Chat 1 — Repo Setup
- Created GitHub repo: jobpulse (private)
- Scaffolded full folder structure
- Branching strategy: dev → main

## Chat 2 — Himalayas Ingestor + AWS Setup
Date: 2025-04-17

### Built
- ingestion/sources/himalayas/ingest_himalayas.py
- tests/test_ingest_himalayas.py

### AWS
- Fresh account created, root MFA enabled
- IAM user varun-admin created with AdministratorAccess
- AWS CLI configured (ap-south-1)
- Free tier active, $100 credits, billing alarm set

### Key Decisions
- Himalayas first: no API key, clean JSON, sets pattern for all ingestors
- Gzip on bronze: ~5x compression, cheaper S3
- Hive partitioning: snapshot_date=YYYY-MM-DD/source=himalayas/
- No keys in code: boto3 reads ~/.aws/credentials locally, IAM role on Lambda in prod
- Mocking in tests: no real HTTP/S3 calls, fast and offline-safe
- dry_run flag: fetch without S3 write, safe for local testing
- lambda_handler returns dict: Step Functions reads status to decide next state
